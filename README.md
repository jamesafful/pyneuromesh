# PyNeuroMesh

**PyNeuroMesh** is a hybrid meshing pipeline that integrates neural implicit surface representations with classical mesh generation. It uses neural networks to learn signed distance functions (SDFs) and adaptive refinement fields to guide high-quality mesh generation using GMSH.

## ðŸ”‘ Features

- **Neural SDF Models** â€” Learn continuous geometry via MLPs.
- **GMSH Integration** â€” Surface extraction via marching cubes, meshing with GMSH.
- **Adaptive Refinement** â€” Use `RefineNet` to predict local mesh size.
- **Training Pipelines** â€” Includes synthetic and simulation-aware training scripts.
- **Python + CLI Access** â€” Scriptable modules and runnable command-line tools.
